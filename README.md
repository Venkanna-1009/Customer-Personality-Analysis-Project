### Customer-Personality-Analysis-Project

This project focuses on Analyzing customer segments from a given dataset using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to cluster customers based on their personality traits and other relevant features using a classifier model


key steps involved:- 
  1)  Data Ingestion
  2)  Data pre-processing
  3)  Feature Engineering
  4)  Model building
  5)  Hyperparameter tuning
  6)  Model Evaluation
  7)  Model Deployment.


Developed this project by using Python and machine learning algorithms and used frameworks such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, matplotlib, scikitlearn and streamlit.

Worked on customer personality analysis while using various unsupervised algorithms such as K-means ,Agglomerative ,DBSCAN for
identifying distinct customer segments for marketing strategies.

While, In model building supervised algorithms such as Random Forest classifier with training & testing accuracy of 99%.
